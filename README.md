# Evaluating ChatGPT for Constructing Two-Level Fractional Factorial Designs

## Abstract

Design of Experiments (DoE) plays a central role in engineering and statistical research by enabling the study of multiple factors with a minimal number of tests. Among the most widely used methods are **two-level fractional factorial designs**, which allow researchers to evaluate main effects and interactions of several factors efficiently.

With the rise of generative AI, especially **ChatGPT**, there is increasing interest in using these models to automate experimental design construction. However, the **accuracy and statistical quality** of AI-generated designs remain unverified. This repository provides the first **systematic evaluation** of ChatGPT's ability to generate valid two-level fractional factorial designs using a curated dataset of tasks derived from standard DoE literature.

## Objectives

- Develop a benchmark dataset with tasks for generating two-level fractional factorial designs.
- Evaluate the performance of ChatGPT (GPT-4o) in constructing such designs.
- Compare ChatGPT-generated designs with optimal solutions from authoritative catalogs.
- Provide Python scripts for reproducing numerical experiments and accuracy evaluations.
